# ag-data-mgmt-resources

### Project Goal: 

Establish online resource of data management tools and recommendations. A nice resource for best practices for busy scientists we can refer people to.
 
### 5 main areas to address 
*(not in any particular order)*
 
1. File naming & organization
1. Documentation
1. Version control
1. Spreadsheets
1. Tidy data
 
### We want for each:
 
* A quick take on each: what it is and why you need this
* More resources for a deep dive (e.g. web links)
* Templates & tools to help when applicable
 
### Next Steps:
 
* ~~Sara will port her resources to a google drive folder and share~~
* Julia will set up a structure for a gitbook on github (do we want this private for now or public?) for this
* ~~Sara will track down references for her library  (Julia can port this over to a public Zotero library)~~
* Everyone will make sure they can access github from their main computer, either through the git bash terminal, the GitHub desktop client or RStudio.
